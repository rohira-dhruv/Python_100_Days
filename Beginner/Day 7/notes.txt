If you have a complex problem on your hands, we must try to break it into smaller problems that can be solved easily.
Creating flowcharts also helps you to understand the flow of the complex problem. (lucid chart or diagrams.net are two good websites).

For Hangman,

--> Start
--> Generate a random word.
--> Generate as many blanks as letters in the word.
--> Ask the user to enter a letter.
--> is the letter in the word?
--> if yes, replace the blank with the letter.
--> if all blanks are filled, you win
--> if no, lose a life.
--> if all lives are lost, you lose.
