__init__ is the Constructor method for the class.
Initialise the object and its attributes.

class Car:
    def __init__(self, seats):
        self.seats = seats

my_car = Car(5)

but we can't have a default constructor like this,i.e, Car() will give an error.

Adding methods to a class:

def enter_race_model(self):
    self.seats = 2
